otw-full-width-page.php

If your theme does not have a full width page template you can use this file. Copy otw-full-width-page.php. Paste it in your theme’s folder. Go to “Add new page” in your WP administration. You should now see “OTW page full width” in your Template's dropdown. 
Please note that there is no guarantee this file will work as is since page templates are very theme specific and it might require some modifications.
